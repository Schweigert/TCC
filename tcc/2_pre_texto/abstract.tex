In this work we approach the crew scheduling problem (CSP), a $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem.
To deal with it's intractability, we did a research in search of exact methods capable of
working with the large amount of variable that the problem has. We decided to use the
column generation method to obtain an exact solution to the problem and to use
one or more (meta) heuristics to reduce the processing time.
