The increasing popularization of mass games demands new technological approaches in order to meet the needs of users with lower cost of computational resources.
%
Designing these architectures, from the network point of view, is relevant and impacting to the success of these games.
%
The objective of this work is to propose an analysis aimed at identifying approaches to optimize the computational resources consumed by the identified architectures.
%
This objective will be achieved after conducting a referenced search, followed by an analysis of the main architectures and, preferably, the execution of simulations using a computational cloud to assist in the identification of resource bottlenecks. The results obtained will help service providers to reduce maintenance costs and improve the quality of such services.
