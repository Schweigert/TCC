The increasing popularization of \acf{mmorpg} demands new technological approaches in order to supply the requirements of users with lower cost of computational resources.
%
Designing these architectures, from the network point of view, is relevant and impacting to the success of these games.
%
The objective of this work is to propose an analysis aimed at identifying approaches to optimize the computational resources consumed by the identified architectures.
%
This objective will be achieved after conducting a referenced search, followed by an analysis of the main architectures and, respectively, the execution of clients simulations using \ac{mmorpg} architectures in a computational cloud to help identifying resources bottlenecks.
%
The results obtained will help \ac{mmorpg} service providers to reduce maintenance costs and improve the quality of such services.
